# CS50x Problem Sets Repository

Welcome to my repository of problem sets from Harvard's CS50x course! Here, youâ€™ll find my solutions to the exercises and practical problems I encountered throughout the course. This repository is a way to share knowledge, enhance skills in computer science, and collaborate with other students.

## What is Harvard's CS50x?

CS50x is an online version of Harvard's introductory course in computer science. Throughout the course, fundamental programming and computing concepts are explored, including algorithms, data structures, programming languages, and software development.

The course is divided into weeks, each covering specific topics. Typically, a module includes: 1 lecture, 1 section, several shorts, and a few problem sets.

## Concepts Covered in Each Problem Set

* [Problem Set 1](https://github.com/OLuizFernando/psets_cs50x_2024/tree/main/problem_sets/pset1): C
* [Problem Set 2](https://github.com/OLuizFernando/psets_cs50x_2024/tree/main/problem_sets/pset2): Arrays
* [Problem Set 3](https://github.com/OLuizFernando/psets_cs50x_2024/tree/main/problem_sets/pset3): Algorithms
* [Problem Set 4](https://github.com/OLuizFernando/psets_cs50x_2024/tree/main/problem_sets/pset4): Memory
* [Problem Set 5](https://github.com/OLuizFernando/psets_cs50x_2024/tree/main/problem_sets/pset5): Data Structures
* [Problem Set 6](https://github.com/OLuizFernando/psets_cs50x_2024/tree/main/problem_sets/pset6): Python
* [Problem Set 7](https://github.com/OLuizFernando/psets_cs50x_2024/tree/main/problem_sets/pset7): SQL
